## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #775ADA (RGB). This vibrant violet-blue adds a touch of sophistication to the application while staying modern. It works well against both light and dark backgrounds.
- Background color: #1A1A2E (RGB). A very dark, desaturated purple serves as a neutral backdrop, especially suited to dark mode as the default, emphasizing data and visuals without causing eye strain.
- Accent color: #FF69B4 (RGB). A vivid, playful pink will draw attention to the most important interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, headlines and data displays
- Use flat, minimalist icons to represent speed test parameters and settings.
- Implement a clean, tab-based layout for easy navigation between speed test, history, and settings.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations for gauge movements and data updates.
